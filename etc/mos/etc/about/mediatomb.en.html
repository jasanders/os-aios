<p>MediaTomb is an open source (GPL) UPnP MediaServer with a nice web 
user interface, it allows you to stream your digital media through your 
home network and listen to/watch it on a variety of UPnP compatible devices.</p>

<p>MediaTomb implements the UPnP MediaServer V 1.0 specification that can be 
found on http://www.upnp.org/. The current implementation focuses on parts 
that are required by the specification, however we look into extending the 
functionality to cover the optional parts of the spec as well.</p>

<p>MediaTomb should work with any UPnP compliant MediaRenderer, please 
tell us if you experience difficulties with particular models, also take 
a look at the Supported Devices list for more information.</p>
