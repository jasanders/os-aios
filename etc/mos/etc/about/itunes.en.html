<p>mt-daapd, now known as the Firefly Media Server, is a DAAP 
(Digital Audio Access Protocol) server that works with most 
POSIX-compatible operating systems. It allows you to share 
your music collection over the local network using the DAAP 
protocol also used by Apple's iTunes.</p>

<p>Popular uses of the Firefly Media Server include serving your 
digital music library to iTunes clients and/or SoundBridge devices from Roku.</p>

<p>Built-in transcoding support enables serving popular free music formats like 
FLAC, Ogg Vorbis or Musepack to those clients that do not otherwise support 
these formats. Transcoding happens on the fly, with the target format usually 
being WAV.</p>

<p>The server also features a web interface that can be used to control 
components of the server, trigger database updates, and create playlists.</p>
