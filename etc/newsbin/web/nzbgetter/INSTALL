 - HOW TO UPGRADE WHEN USING VERSION 1.0 or 1.1
================================================================================

 1. Backup nzbg_download.xml (and nzbg_queue.xml when using 1.1)

 This file can be found in the /nzbgetter/conf/ directory.
 Copy it to save location. It contains your download list.

 2. Remove or rename old nzbgetter directory

 We prefer to rename first to make sure this installation
 goes well.
