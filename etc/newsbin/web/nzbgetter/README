 - INSTALL
================================================================================
 1. Unpack
 
 Installation is pretty simple. Just unpack NZBGetter to a directory
 on your webserver. Please leave all subdirectories as they are otherwise
 the script will not run properly.
 
 2. Script folder restrictions
 
 Make sure the following folders are writable (these folders contain log
 files and appication configuration files):
 
 /log/
 /conf/
 /__exec__/dummy/
 
 3. Usenet Reader watch folder restrictions
 
 Make sure this script can write NZB files to your Usenet Reader NZB 
 incoming watch folder.
 
 4. Load script in webbrowser
 
 Open a webbrowser window and load the script.
 
 http://your.webserver/path.to.nzbgetter/index.php
 
 When you start the application the first time it will ask you to complete
 the settings.
 
 5. Enjoy!

================================================================================
 - HOW TO UPGRADE WHEN USING VERSION 1.0 or 1.1
================================================================================

 1. Backup nzbg_download.xml (and nzbg_queue.xml when using 1.1)

 This file can be found in the /nzbgetter/conf/ directory.
 Copy it to save location. It contains your download list.

 2. Remove or rename old nzbgetter directory

 We prefer to rename first to make sure this installation
 goes well.

 3. Unpack

 Installation is pretty simple. Just unpack NZBGetter to a directory
 on your webserver. Please leave all subdirectories as they are otherwise
 the script will not run properly.
 
 4. Script folder restrictions
 
 Make sure the following folders are writable (these folders contain log
 files and appication configuration files):
 
 /log/
 /conf/
 /__exec__/dummy/
 /__exec__/queue/
 
 5. Restore backup download list
 
 Copy you backup download list xml file (as in step 1) to the /nzbgetter/conf/
 directory, it will ask you to overwrite the one which comes with the fres
 installation. You can do that without a problem.
 
 6. Load script in webbrowser
 
 Open a webbrowser window and load the script.
 
 http://your.webserver/path.to.nzbgetter/index.php
 
 When you start the application the first time it will ask you to complete
 the settings.
